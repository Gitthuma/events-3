Events 3

In our final events-related task, you need to set an event listener on the &lt;button&gt;s' parent element (&lt;div class="button-bar"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt;), which when invoked by clicking any of the buttons will set the background of the button-bar to the color contained in the button's data-color attribute.

We want you to solve this without looping through all the buttons and giving each one their own event listener.
